The AI engineer's work primarily focused on extending the Uniform Factory application by implementing several new features and addressing numerous deployment and data-related challenges. Key accomplishments include the integration of product import from , comprehensive SEO enhancements (meta-tags, sitemap, robots.txt, Schema.org), and fixing the Web Vitals monitoring. A significant portion of the effort was dedicated to debugging persistent frontend deployment issues, often stemming from browser caching or misconfigured development vs. production server setups. The AI demonstrated an iterative problem-solving approach, adapting to user feedback and external tool diagnostics (e.g., , ) to overcome these hurdles, especially concerning domain migration and frontend build inconsistencies across different deployments.

<product_requirements>
The Uniform Factory needs a modern, responsive website with a product catalog and order calculator, extended with an admin panel for content management and analytics. Initial requirements included core pages, email notifications, and basic site analytics. Recent, explicit requests focused on: implementing a robust product search with article numbers and filters; integrating a Telegram notification bot; developing extended analytics for popular items, conversion, and traffic sources; comprehensive SEO optimization (meta-tags, sitemap, Open Graph for VK); the ability to copy products from  into specific categories; connecting the  domain; reorganizing the admin panel with a Content section to manage images, portfolio, legal documents, and page texts, alongside updating the company founding year to 1993 (30+ years of experience); replacing generic social media links with VK and Telegram; and ensuring product article numbers are displayed consistently on product cards and detail pages.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing several issues related to deployment and feature visibility. After successfully updating social media links to VK and Telegram, and verifying that product article numbers were correctly displayed in category listings on the  domain, the user reported a new issue: the article number was still missing inside a specific product detail card on the *preview* domain: . This indicates the current focus is on debugging this specific UI rendering issue for individual product pages, potentially a frontend component issue or data fetching discrepancy for that particular product. This follows extensive work on SEO, Web Vitals monitoring, admin panel reorganization, and domain connection, all of which faced persistent caching and deployment synchronization challenges between development and production environments, and across different Emergent deployments.
