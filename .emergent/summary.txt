The AI engineer successfully transformed a nascent MVP into a robust, multi-page application for Uniform Factory. This involved significant feature additions and extensive UI/UX refinements. Key accomplishments include the full implementation of an administrative panel, a comprehensive site-wide rebranding (logos, company name, dark blue color theme), and a successful migration from a single-page architecture to a multi-page structure with dedicated routes. The engineer also addressed critical form functionality across the site and meticulously updated contact information, including an interactive Yandex Map. The latest work focused on building a detailed product catalog, with backend models, services, and API endpoints already established, and frontend page components (, ) created. The engineer demonstrated strong debugging skills, addressing API routing issues, database schema inconsistencies, and frontend rendering errors.

<product_requirements>
The user, representing Uniform Factory, initially sought a modern, responsive website with core pages (Home, About Us, Catalog, Contacts, Portfolio), inspired by specific design references and using a purple accent (later changed). Essential functionalities included a product catalog, order cost calculator, interactive elements, and professional design. Subsequent requests expanded to an administrative panel for content management (categories, portfolio, requests), email notifications (initially SendGrid, then Yandex SMTP), and deployment on the Emergent platform. Key fixes included non-functional navigation, mobile responsiveness, and accurate contact details. Major evolution involved converting the site to a multi-page structure, a complete rebranding (new logos, removing AVIK, dark blue theme), making the header logo clickable, and the latest request to implement a comprehensive product catalog with detailed product cards, multiple photos, descriptions, characteristics, and full admin capabilities for managing these items.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively developing a new product catalog feature. The backend has been significantly extended: new SQLAlchemy models (, ) have been created in , integrated into the SQLite database setup in , and CRUD operations for products are available through  in . Corresponding API endpoints have been added to  for public access and to  for administrative management. Backend setup, including schema updates and initial data population with example products, is complete and functional. On the frontend, the architectural groundwork has been laid with the creation of two new page components:  (for category-specific product listings) and  (for individual product details). The current state of work is at the cusp of integrating these new frontend pages and components into the existing application navigation and displaying the product data fetched from the backend.
