<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully built a full-stack application for AVIK Uniform Factory, starting from a Russian user's high-level requirements. The project progressed through several distinct phases: initial frontend development with mock data, backend implementation with MongoDB, troubleshooting deployment issues, migrating the backend to SQLite, and extensive UI/UX refinement based on user feedback. The engineer meticulously addressed non-functional links, static buttons, and ensured mobile responsiveness. The work culminated in starting the development of an administrative panel, indicating a transition from a static MVP to a manageable application. The engineer demonstrated strong problem-solving skills, adapting to platform limitations (MongoDB Atlas user limit) and user preferences (switching to SQLite, adding Telegram bot functionality).

<product_requirements>
The user, representing AVIK Uniform Factory, requested a modern, adaptive website for their corporate uniform manufacturing business. Key requirements included:
-   **Core Pages:** Home, About Us, Catalog, Contacts, Portfolio (of completed works).
-   **Design References:** Inspired by aviktime.ru and enchy.ru, using the provided AVIK Uniform Factory logo as a base for the color scheme (purple accent).
-   **Functionality:** Responsive design, product catalog with filtering, order cost calculator, portfolio, and professional agency-quality design.
-   **Interactivity:** All interactive elements (buttons, forms) should work.
-   **Content Management:** Later requested an admin panel for managing content, uploading photos, and viewing requests.
-   **Notifications:** Initially email notifications for order calculations, then shifted to Telegram bot notifications, and back to email.
-   **Deployment:** Deployment on Emergent platform, with options for custom domains.
-   **Specific Fixes:** Addressed issues like non-functional navigation links (e.g., Contacts, Order a Call, Footer links) and ensuring correct display of contact information.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frontend:** React.js, Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS, Axios for API calls, React Router for navigation.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic for data validation, SQLAlchemy for ORM (with SQLite), Motor for MongoDB (initially).
-   **Database:** MongoDB (initial, then removed), SQLite (current local database).
-   **Environment:** Dockerized setup, Supervisor for service control, environment variables for sensitive data and URLs.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and currently uses SQLite as the database.

**Directory Structure (Simplified):**



-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Main FastAPI application. Configures CORS, includes API routes, and manages database connection (now uses ).
-   **/app/backend/models.py**: Defines SQLAlchemy models (, , , , ). Renamed from Pydantic models to avoid conflicts during SQLite migration.
-   **/app/backend/database_sqlite.py**: Manages SQLite database connection and initialization. Sets up SQLAlchemy engine and session.
-   **/app/backend/services_sqlite.py**: Contains business logic for interacting with the SQLite database, including CRUD operations for various models.
-   **/app/backend/admin_routes.py**: New file for backend API routes specifically for the admin panel, including functionality for categories, portfolio, and orders.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Main React application file. Manages routing using  and includes all page components.
-   **/app/frontend/src/mock.js**: Initially provided mock data for frontend development, now replaced by API calls.
-   **/app/frontend/src/services/api.js**: Centralized service for making API requests to the backend.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/\*.jsx**: Various React components for the public-facing website (Header, Footer, Hero, Catalog, Portfolio, Calculator, etc.). Many have been updated to integrate with the backend and respond to user feedback (e.g., adding uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) attributes for navigation,  handlers for buttons).
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/ui/\*.jsx**: Reusable Shadcn UI components used throughout the application.
-   **/app/frontend/src/components/admin/\*.jsx**: New components being developed for the admin panel (e.g., , , , , , ).
-   **/app/frontend/.env**: Contains  for frontend API calls.
-   **/app/backend/.env**: Contains  (currently reverted to local MongoDB for development, but planned for external SQLite or MongoDB Atlas) and .
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the development of the admin panel (frontend routing and full functionality for managing categories, portfolio, orders, and statistics).
-   Implement email notification functionality for user requests.
-   Obtain Telegram Chat ID for Telegram notifications (user provided token, but not chat ID).
-   Decide on the final database for deployment and update  with correct connection string.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively developing the administrative panel for the AVIK Uniform Factory website. This involved both backend and frontend work.

**Backend:**
-   A new file, , was created to house the API endpoints for the admin panel, allowing management of categories, portfolio items, and orders.

**Frontend:**
-   The AI had started creating the necessary React components for the admin interface:
    -   : The main wrapper for the admin section.
    -   : The navigation sidebar for the admin panel.
    -   : Component for managing product categories.
    -   : Component for managing portfolio entries.
    -   : Component for managing customer orders/requests.
    -   : Component for displaying application statistics.

The last action recorded was the creation of , and the AI stated its intention to create the main application for the admin section and configure its routing within the frontend. The system is in a state where the core public-facing website is fully functional with SQLite, but the admin panel is under active construction.
