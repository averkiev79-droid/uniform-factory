The AI engineer effectively expanded the Uniform Factory application, transitioning it to a multi-page architecture and implementing a robust product catalog. Key challenges involved synchronizing frontend and backend data, localizing media, and refining UI/UX. The trajectory covers recent work on administrative features like an image gallery, legal document management, and site analytics (Yandex.Metrica, Web Vitals). Critical bugs related to image loading paths and database inconsistencies were systematically addressed. The latest work focused on implementing advanced search with filters, product article numbers, an analytics dashboard, SEO optimization (meta-tags, sitemap, Open Graph for VK), and a Telegram notification bot. The AI demonstrated a methodical approach, often diagnosing issues, providing multiple solutions, and adapting to user feedback, including preferences for specific social media and deployment strategies.

<product_requirements>
The Uniform Factory required a modern, responsive website with core pages (Home, About Us, Catalog, Contacts, Portfolio), a product catalog, order calculator, and interactive elements. This expanded to include an admin panel for categories, portfolio, and requests, with email notifications. Previous fixes addressed navigation, mobile responsiveness, and contact details. Major updates involved a multi-page structure, rebranding, and a comprehensive product catalog. Explicit requests included removing product sizes/stock, activating favorite/share, cookie consent, favicon, image loading fixes, navigation bugs, improved footer forms, clickable advantages, and, more recently:
- Admin panel for main page photos (hero, about).
- Email notifications (Yandex SMTP).
- WhatsApp consultant (later removed).
- Site visit statistics (Yandex.Metrica) and load speed monitoring (Web Vitals).
- Admin-editable legal documents (Privacy Policy, User Agreement, Company Details).
- Swipe gestures for product images on mobile.
- Admin panel gallery for uploaded photos.
- **New requests:** Product search (name, filters, autocomplete, article), Telegram bot, extended analytics (popular items, conversion, traffic sources), SEO (meta-tags, sitemap, Open Graph for VK, content for promotion), copy products from aviktime.ru (specific categories), connect  domain.

<pending_tasks>
- Complete the integration of the  component into  if not fully completed (it was mostly done).
- Implement full Re-Deploy to make the Search button visible on the deployed version.
- Implement the Product Import feature (copying products from aviktime.ru).
- Connect the  domain.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed the integration of the Telegram notification bot into the backend. This involved adding  and  to , creating  to handle Telegram API calls, installing the  library, and integrating notification calls into all relevant contact form endpoints (, , , ) in . The backend was restarted, and the Telegram bot was confirmed to be sending test messages successfully. Prior to this, extensive work was done on Phase 1 (Search, Filters, Article, Analytics) and Phase 2 (SEO), which included backend API development for search and analytics, frontend components for search and analytics dashboard, and comprehensive SEO meta-tag implementation for various pages. A bug where the frontend search button was not appearing due to caching on the deployed version was identified, and the user chose to defer a full re-deploy until later tasks were completed. All images on the deployed site () are confirmed to be loading correctly, and product cards are displaying.

<optional_next_step>
The next logical step is to test the newly integrated Telegram bot by sending a test request via the website forms.
