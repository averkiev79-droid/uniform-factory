The AI engineer effectively steered the Uniform Factory application through significant feature expansions and bug fixes. The journey involved transitioning to a multi-page architecture, establishing a robust product catalog, and resolving persistent image loading issues by localizing all media. A key iterative challenge was synchronizing frontend expectations with backend data structures, particularly for dynamic content and form submissions, leading to several rounds of debugging for API responses and database interactions. Frontend UI/UX was consistently refined, adding features like dynamic image loading with skeleton loaders, mobile swipe gestures for carousels, and improved footer responsiveness. Backend development focused on creating flexible data models and API endpoints for app settings, legal documents, and analytics. Throughout, the AI systematically addressed user feedback, adapting implementations and correcting errors, demonstrating a thorough problem-solving approach in a full-stack environment.

<product_requirements>
The Uniform Factory required a modern, responsive website with Home, About Us, Catalog, Contacts, and Portfolio pages, featuring a product catalog, order calculator, and interactive elements. This expanded to include an admin panel for managing categories, portfolio, and requests, alongside email notifications. Critical bug fixes addressed navigation, mobile responsiveness, and contact details. Major updates involved converting to a multi-page structure, rebranding, and implementing a comprehensive product catalog with detailed product cards, multiple photos, descriptions, and full admin capabilities. Explicit requests included removing product sizes/stock labels, activating favorite/share features, cookie consent banner, favicon, resolving persistent image loading issues, fixing navigation bugs (back buttons, scroll to top), improving footer form visibility, making advantages clickable to dedicated pages, and, most recently: adding admin panel function to replace main page photos (hero, about); implementing email notifications (Yandex SMTP); adding a WhatsApp online consultant (later removed); integrating site visit statistics (Yandex.Metrica) and load speed monitoring (Web Vitals); creating dedicated, admin-editable pages for legal documents (Privacy Policy, User Agreement, Company Details); adding swipe gestures for product images on mobile; and implementing an admin panel gallery to view uploaded photos.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was actively implementing a new administrative panel feature to allow viewing of all uploaded images. This task involved creating a new backend API endpoint () to retrieve a list of image files stored on the server. Concurrently, a new frontend React component, , was being developed to present these images in a gallery format within the admin interface. The very last action performed was the creation of this  component and the initiation of its integration into  to make it accessible via the admin navigation menu. This work is a direct response to a user request for better management and visibility of uploaded media. Prior to this, several issues were addressed, including fixing the inconsistent display of main page images caused by database resets, and improving the markdown rendering for legal documents, though the latter still requires further refinement for structured text.
